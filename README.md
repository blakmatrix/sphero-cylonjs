# sphero-cylonjs - For Nodebots International Day 2015
http://slides.com/farrinreid/nodebots-intl-day-2015/live#/

## How to get started

pull down this repo

`git clone https://github.com/blakmatrix/sphero-cylonjs.git`
`cd sphero-cylonjs`
`npm i -d`

Take a look at http://cylonjs.com/documentation/drivers/sphero/
as well as http://cylonjs.com/documentation/helpers/

## Exercises

1. The first exercise requires you to write a few lines of code so you can learn how to orient your robot and press the spacebar to hurl your sphero at some "bowling" pins. Run it with `node bowling`
2. The second exercise looks complex but isn't, it is designed to be run in a slolum type setting, for racing against others, but first you need to write a little code to get your sphero to move. run it with`node navigation`. 
  * [Optionally: I've included advanced things you can do with this program, as you can also tap into accelerometer data, this would be useful for many things, but one of the most interesting things you can do with it is to not only detect a collision, but also understand where the sphero was hit, and perhaps take that data and move in an opposite direction, or build a "map" of the area]
3. The third exercise run it with `node shakeometer`, it's a bit more complex to understand, but is straightforward in asking the user to write some code to alter the reality of Sphero.
